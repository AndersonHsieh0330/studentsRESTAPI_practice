# studentsRESTAPI_practice
This project is done by following [this course](https://amigoscode.com/p/spring-boot) while making lots of comments for me to understand how Spring boot works. Mostly a practice for building WMMA_WhereMyMoneyAt. The code setup is connected to local MySQL database. Shout out to amigoscode for the awesome tutorial! 


## WMMA supports:
- Restful api through HTTP 
- CRUD operation to data in local MySQL db

## Some new things Iâ€™ve learned:
- Building a Restful API with spring boot

## Libraries and resources I used 
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
